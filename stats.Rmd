### CDF for binomial
n <- 100
# n also can be more than 250
n <- 250
p <- 0.5
x <- 0:n
y <-plot(x, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = p), main = "Probability mass function for Bin(100,0.5)")
barplot(y,names.arg=x) #Probability mass function for Bin(100,0.5)
plot(x, pbinom(x, size = n, prob = p), type="s", main = "Cumulative distribution function for Bin(100,0.5)")


### CDF for Normal
mu    <- 50
sigma <- 5 # standard deviation

curve(dnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma), # notice the 3rd argument is the sd
      from = 0, to = 100,
      main = "PDF for a standard normal")

curve(pnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma),from = 0, to = 100, main = "CDF for a standard normal",ylab = "F(x)")


#CDFs of binomial pdf and normal pdf on the same graph (If it gives warning or error, you can try it on R script and it will work definetly)
plot(x, pbinom(x, size = n, prob = p), type="s", col = 'blue')
curve(pnorm(x, mean = mu, sd = sigma),from = 0, to = 100, main = "CDF for a standard normal",ylab = "F(x)", add = TRUE, col = 'red')

## So, functions are almost similar.
## The reasons behind these similarity have to do with the effect of n (the number of trials)
## and p (probablity of success). By small size of n and small p (like 0.1), the binomial
## distribution would look like skewed to right. For large p and small n, the distribution would be skewed to left
## In our case, we have a large p (0.5) and large n (100) therefore the pdf looks like symmetric.
## For normal pdf, again we have a large n (100) and together with its parameters
## its distribution is almost symmetric and bell shaped.  
## Central Limit Theorem (CLT) suggests that the sampling distribution of the 
## sample mean is normally distributed (as n increases or goes to infinity), 
## regardless of the distribution of the underlying random sample (binomial or normal, CLT applies for both).
# Hence,cdf of binomial and normal distributions seem similar as cdf of binomial converges to the standard normal cdf.

n = 192
E_Ui = 0 #Expected value of Ui
Var_Ui = 1/12 #Variance value of Ui
CLT = (2/n)/(sqrt(Var_Ui)/sqrt(n)) # From the CLT formula
print(CLT) # This value corresponds to 0.6915 and 0.3085 in Z score table
result = 0.6915 - 0.3085 # The result of P(|Z| <= CLT)
print(result)
